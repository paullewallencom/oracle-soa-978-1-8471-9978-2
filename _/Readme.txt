This folder contains artifacts and solutions for the 
	SOA 11gR1 Hands-on Tutorial, version 1.0, September 2009

These materials are used with the book: 
	"Getting Started with 
	 Oracle SOA Suite 11g R1: A Hands-On Tutorial"
available from http://www.packtpub.com or http://www.amazon.com

Unzip the archive file to c:\stageSOA. You will see a top-level 
directory named po. Copy po to c:\po.  

Inside the c:\po directory, you have the following directories: 
• bin - executable files 
• input - sample input data files 
• lib - JAR library file 
• schemas - XSD files used throughout when defining services 
• solutions\chXX - a solution project for each chapter 
• sql - database scripts used during setup 

The instructions in this book assume that you are working on the 
Microsoft Windows operating system and that you are using this 
default path of c:\po for the files used by the tutorial. 

If you are using the Linux operating system or another location 
for the tutorial files, you will need to remember to adjust 
instructions accordingly when operating system-specific 
instructions are specified or c:\po is referenced.
